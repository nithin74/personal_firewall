# 🔥 Python Personal Firewall (GUI + iptables)

A lightweight personal firewall built using **Python**, **Scapy**, **Tkinter**, and **iptables**.  
It sniffs packets, blocks traffic based on user-defined rules, and gives real-time control with a GUI.

## 💡 Features

- 🧠 Custom rule-based blocking from `rules.json`
- 📦 Scapy-based packet sniffer (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- 🛡️ Real-time GUI with Start/Stop buttons
- 🔥 iptables integration to enforce system-level blocks
- 🧾 Logs allowed traffic to `logs/blocked.log`
